possible idea:
The game revolves around 10 floors of randomly generated dungeon.
The dungeon is almost completely dark. The player can without light see only a few feet in front of them
The player can use a torch to light up the area. But be warned: light attracts unwanted attention.

Torch:
Torches are items that can be picked up. When used, they provide extra visibility to make navigation easier.

Apperture of nightvision:
The apperture of nightvision is a special item. When used, it produces a snapshot of the players current vision
with nightvision, creating a picture that shows the visible area with nightvision. The apperture has a cooldown.

Throwable rocks:
Can be thrown. Produce an audible noise when hitting something.

inventory?

The entity:
The entity is a creature that stalks the dungeon looking for victims. Players have no way of killing the entity
so they spend the game avoiding it.
