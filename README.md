## SDL
this project uses SDL2 version `2.28.2` and SDL extention library SDL2_image version `2.6.3`. The required sources are provided in the deps directory. I've moved the required `.dll` files to the root of the project to make it a bit more portable, so messing around with environment variables should not be required. Besides this it's pretty much a 1 to 1 copy of the original source code.

You can download the SDL2 source [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases). SDL2_image can be found [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases). You need to use the `*-VC.zip` files.
